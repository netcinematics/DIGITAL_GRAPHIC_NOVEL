# DIGITAL_GRAPHIC_NOVEL
GOAL: create a Digital Graphic Novel Series on the BLOCKCHAIN!

Sounds easy enough, what could be so difficult? Well, it isn't easy. With all the visuals, story and audio complete all that remains is for the CINEMATIC to be uploaded to the BLOCKCHAIN. And that is where a massive vastness of Web3, DApp, and Crypto technology awaits.

## Web3 DApp and Crypto

The Web3 ecosystem is actually very large. Evaluating which technologies exist and which fit the needs of the project - is exhaustive. Here is a short list of the preferred technology stack (so far).

- OpenSea
- Polygon (on Matic) / ETH on Ethereum blockchain.
- Web3 / ethers
- Hardhat / Truffle 
- Hardhat Network / Ganache-CLI
- OpenZeppelin / ERC721 or ERC1155
- Solidity in Remix and VSCode (plugin)
